                        Dreamweaver is considered WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get), meaning that when you format your Web page, you see the results of the formatting instead of the mark-ups that are used for formatting. HTML is not WYSIWYG, whereas Microsoft Word is WYSIWYG. However, Dreamweaver allows you to hand code HTML as well. Dreamweaver also supports CSS and JavaScript as well as other languages including ASP and PHP.
