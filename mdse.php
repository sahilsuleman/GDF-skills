<p class="more">The requirements for a government job will see a significant change by 2020. The National Skills Qualification Framework (NSQF), a competency-based framework that organizes all qualifications according to a series of level of knowledge, skills and aptitude, is going to play a major role as it will become mandatory for a government job by 2020.
    NSQF is expected to integrate voc cational education, skill training, general education, technical education and the job market.
    
    "By 2020 an educational qualification will not be enough. You would need a NSQF to apply for any vacancy in the government," said Minister of State for Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, Rajiv Pratap Rudy.
    
    NSQF was notified in December 2013 and it provides a five year implantation period. It states that by recruitment rules of the Government of India and PSUs of the central government will be amended to define eligibility criteria for all positions in terms of NSQF levels. The state governments and their PSUs will also be encouraged to amend their recruitment rules accordingly.
    
    It also says by government funding will not be available for any training /educational programme/ course which is not NSQF-complaint. All government funded training and educational institutions will define eligibility criteria for admission to various courses in terms of NSQF levels.
    
    Under NSQF, the learner can acquire the certification for competency needed at any level through formal, non-formal or informal learning. The NSQF is anchored at the National Skill Development Agency (NSDA) and is being implemented through the National Skills Qualification Committee (NSQC).</p>
